# Backtesting my current US stocks portfolio
The whole project is conducted under R, and the library "tidyquant" is heavily utilized.<br>
For a quick starting guide, please refer to https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyquant/vignettes/TQ00-introduction-to-tidyquant.html <br>

This backtest serves as a regular risk monitoring procedure.<br>
As a high-level overview, below are the main steps for the backtest procedure:<br>

1. Current weight of the portfolio is retrieved
2. The period for backtesting is set (Default = 3 years)
3. Daily stock returns over the past 3 years are obtained from yahoo finance
4. Monthly portfolio returns are calculated from the daily stock returns by the function tq_portfolio()
5. Some ETFs/indices that serve as benchmarks are chosen and their data is obtained again through yahoo finance
6. Various performance metrics (e.g. Historical ES, Annualized Sharpe ratio, beta) are calculated by the function tq_performance()
7. The time series and density plots of the monthly portfolio return are generated by the function ggplot()
8. The evolution of wealth level is also investigated for both the portfolio and the benchmark indices
